# jpa-hateoas

To be honest, I felt any frustration with Spring Rest Repositories to create.
This is very convenient way to make JPA project. 
Actually, it was possible to make REST service without controller.
But, under the surface, i didn't understand how it works.

This HATEOAS helped me to understand better with those ways. thanks.
